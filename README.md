# Story

One day, I had to introduce my self as a part of teaming activity, but I didn't have good sense to make fine presentation.

Although it is hard to tell about myself like story, so I decided to ask everything to the dice.

This is a part of Unity project made by such motivation.

# Remarks

Some resources like textures and fonts are not commited because those license problem, so you can bring your own resource instead.

## Fonts

In this project, there are two fonts are used.

## Textures

There are one symbolic texure like brand logo, it has light map varian as well.
It is good to use  your corporate logo or your SNS icon instead.

Also there are two sprite animartion textures for field tile and walking person.
Each frame of sprite animation are 64x64 sized and it is placed in following order without any rotation and extra spaces;

- front / stand
- front / left step
- front / right step
- back / stand
- back / left step
- back / right step
- right / stand
- right / left step
- right / right step
- left / stand
- left / left step
- left / right 

Frames in field tiles texture are also 64x64 sized but it is not animated.

I prepared those sprite frames with [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) but you can use any tool you are familiar with.
